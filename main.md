# A Quick Start Guide of Formula One (2021 Season)

This guide includes some of the most important knowledge and concepts that I think is necessary for a new fan to understand what's going on and enjoy the sport. I also added some personal twists and extra stuff that I think is interesting to read. This is because from a sporting sense, F1 is by no means very complex: it's just driving cars, fast! Dramatic crashes and overtakes! The sport itself should be relatively easy to pick up. However, as you can imagine, from a technical standpoint F1 cars are engineering marvels. Each team hires hundreds of the best aerodynamicists, material scientists and engineers in the world, then spends hundreds of millions of dollars developing and producing each year's cars.

If you just wanted to experience the sport and the spectacle, you only need to read Chapters 1 to 3. If you want to learn about some of the details, that will be Chapters 4 to 7. Finally, Chapter 8 is basically how I search for F1 related content. Recommend you to take a peek at that as well.

I'm not a huge history guy, so I didn't include anything related to the early history of F1. Everything here pretty much dates back only to when I started following F1, which is around 2016. You'll quickly learn the big names and famous stories if you decide to start following.

Hope you enjoy!

## Championship and Event Format

The **FIA Formula One World Championship** runs annually from around mid-March to late-November or early-December. F1 is considered the pinnacle of motorsport and as a sport, its popularity around the world is only behind the Olympic Games and the World Cup.

F1 is sanctioned by the [Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fédération_Internationale_de_l'Automobile) (FIA), based in Paris, France.

The typical schedule for recent years consists of 21~23 race events, called "Grand Prix". The Grands Prix usually run every two weeks, but there are some back-to-back race weeks, as well as a month-long summer break in August. These event happen across the world in 20+ countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Oceania.

Currently 10 teams participate in the Championship, each team with 2 drivers. Teams are also called *constructors* because they design and construct their own cars each year.

Every Grand Prix happens from Friday to Sunday of the race week. The sessions are:

- Free Practice 1 (FP1, 90 minutes long) and Free Practice 2 (FP2, 90 minutes long) on Friday
- Free Practice 3 (FP3, 60 minutes long) and Qualifying on Saturday
- Race on Sunday

### Free Practice Sessions

The 3 Practice sessions have very little effect on the race results (unless, say, someone crashed the car late in FP3 and the mechanics couldn't get the car repaired for Qualifying). Teams fiddle with the setup of the car, such as wing and suspension angles, gear ratios and stuff, but these are of course confidential.

I hardly ever watch practice sessions live. I simply check the timesheets after each session.

### Qualifying

Qualifying, or "quali" for short, is to determine the starting positions (i.e. the "grid") for the Sunday race.

Qualifying is very much like a sprint: each driver tries to **set one quick lap time**. Only the fastest lap of each driver are compared, slower laps are ignored.

The drivers have multiple shots of doing so in each of these three smaller sections:

- Q1 (18 mins), all 20 drivers participate. The slowest 5 drivers (P16 to P20) are eliminated and cannot participate in Q2 and Q3. These drivers' starting grid positions are set.
- Q2 (15 mins), top 15 drivers from Q1 participate. The slowest 5 drivers (P11 to P15) are eliminated and cannot participate in Q3. These drivers' starting grid positions are also set.
- Q3 (12 mins), top 10 drivers from Q2 participate. This shootout determines the starting grid positions for P1 to P10. P1 is called "Pole Position".

### Race

The Race is, of course, the glamorous main event of every race weekend.

The race runs for a set number of laps (different for each circuit) but the total race distance for each race is always a little bit over 300km (186 mi) with one exception: the Monaco Grand Prix. The races generally take around 75 to 90 minutes to complete, barring any severe incidents causing stoppages.

Championship points are awarded to the drivers and teams each race based on race results:

| Finishing Position | P1   | P2   | P3   | P4   | P5   | P6   | P7   | P8   | P9   | P10  |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Points             | 25   | 18   | 15   | 12   | 10   | 8    | 6    | 4    | 2    | 1    |

Also, the driver who does the **fastest lap in the race** will be awarded 1 extra point, but only if he finishes in the top 10.

The **Driver's World Champion** is whoever scores the most points over the season. Each team's points are the sum of the points of their drivers. The **Constructor's World Champion** is whichever team that scores the most points. That's pretty much it, no playoffs or any kind of all-star events like in North American sports.

### Side Notes

* Pole position, race win, and podium finish (top-3) are all very noteworthy achievements in a driver's F1 career.
* The grid positions may be changed after qualifying. If a driver or team violated the sporting regulations, such as blocking other drivers on the track, changing a car part that they're not allowed to change, etc., they may be penalized in the form of dropping places on the starting grid. Similarly, drivers can get penalized during the race if they caused a collision, cut corners, forced other drivers off track, etc. The penalties include adding a few seconds to your race time, forcing you to drive through the pitlane (which has a speed limit), or even disqualification.
* All drivers have to do one mandatory pitstop during the race. F1 bans refueling during the race, so pitstops are pretty much only used to change tyres or front wings (if the wing is broken). A typical F1 pitstop nowadays takes only 2.5 seconds. Anything more than 3 to 4 seconds is pretty bad. The best pit crews are sometimes able to do sub-2 second pitstops.
* When incidents happen during the race, say there's been a crash and there's debris on track or a broken barrier, the FIA will deploy the Safety Car which all cars must follow and bunch up behind. No overtakes are allowed and all cars drive at a much lower speed than normal race speeds, then the track workers (called "marshals") can have a safe gap to clean up the mess. This year's Safety Car duties will be shared between two absolutely stunning vehicles: the Mercedes AMG GT R, and (perhaps your favorite) the Aston Martin Vantage.

## The Teams

The 10 teams are, of course, where all the stories revolve around. There are the famous ones with a long history such as Ferrari and McLaren, and newcomers (relatively speaking) like Red Bull and Haas. Here is a quick rundown of all the teams.

### The Big Three

#### Mercedes

![Mercedes-AMG F1 W12 E Performance](./pics/mercedes.jpg){ zoom: 20%; width: 50%;}

Drivers for 2021: [Lewis Hamilton (#44)](#lewis-hamilton-44), [Valtteri Bottas (#77)](#valtteri-bottas-77)

2020 Constructor's Standing: 1st

The all-conquering, dominant Mercedes team has been the team to beat for the past few years. They are double World Champions (Constructor and Driver) 7 seasons in a row (2014-2020), and are still favorites coming into the 2021 season. They have a superb team that developed the best power units and fastest cars of this era. They have Lewis Hamilton, one of the best drivers in F1 history, to drive for them. It's *almost* like they are unbeatable, since they hardly make any mistakes during the race. However, in the past couple of seasons, a trend seems to be developing that when they actually do make mistakes, they make huge ones, which produced several truly thrilling and memorable races (['19 German GP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYHQmBULhLc), ['20 Italian GP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB5yhZdF8SI), ['20 Sakhir GP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0zwR2drgV4)). As their lovable German team principal Toto Wolff would say, "[a colossal fuck-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmffVyNMS6w)".

#### Ferrari

![Scuderia Ferrari SF21](./pics/ferrari.jpg){ zoom: 20%; width: 50%;}

Drivers for 2021: [Charles Leclerc (#16)](#charles-leclerc-16), [Carlos Sainz Jr. (#55)](#carlos-sainz-jr-55)

2020 Constructor's Standing: 6th

Ah, the famous red car. Ferrari is the team with the longest history in F1, and also the most success. It's often said that other teams such as Mercedes participate in F1 to help advertise and sell their road cars, but Ferrari sells road cars to fund their participation in F1. Such is their dedication to the sport over the many decades. However, for the past dozen years they have not had Championship success. They won their last Driver's and Constructor's Champion all the way back in 2007. They were usually able to stay Top-3 in the Constructor's standings, and were even able to challenge Mercedes from 2017 to 2019, but a series of driver errors and strategic mistakes during the race sank their championship hopes. 2020 Season wasn't kind to them as their car performance dropped significantly, because their power unit used in previous years seemed to have broken the regulations and they were caught. It's difficult to see them return to Top-3 in 2021, but their fans (called the "Tifosi") are still extremely passionate as always.

#### Red Bull Racing

![Red Bull Racing RB16B](./pics/rbr.jpg){ zoom: 20%; width: 50%;}

Drivers for 2021: [Max Verstappen (#33)](#max-verstappen-33), [Sergio Perez (#11)](#sergio-perez-11)

2020 Constructor's Standing: 2nd

My favorite team in F1. They are the fun-loving cool guys and mavericks of the F1 grid. Funded by a "fizzy drinks" company, not a lot of people thought they would succeed when they joined F1 in 2005, but they did. They hired the right guys to design and produce competitive cars, developed many talented young drivers, and winning 4 consecutive double World Champions from 2010 to 2013. Like Ferrari, they were able to stay competitive They were unable to challenge Mercedes recently, mostly because of weaker power units, which is not their fault because they did not develop the PUs (more on that [later](#power-unit)). Even with a weaker car, they are able to grab race wins from Mercedes or Ferrari because of their excellent execution during the race.

### The Midfield

#### McLaren

![McLaren MCL35M](./pics/mclaren.jpg){ zoom: 20%; width: 50%;}

Drivers for 2021: [Daniel Ricciardo (#3)](#daniel-ricciardo-3), [Lando Norris (#4)](#lando-norris-4)

2020 Constructor's Standings: 3rd

McLaren is also one of the more historical teams in F1. 



## The Drivers

### Lewis Hamilton (#44)

Nationality: British  

Age: 36  

Drives for: Mercedes

Very much the GOAT no matter how you look at it. He's already got the most pole positions (98) and race wins (95) in F1 history. He's tied with Michael Schumacher for the most Driver Championships (7) and very likely to break this record in 2021. His one-lap (quali) ability is unrivaled, sometimes seemingly able to "outdrive" what the car is capable of. He hardly makes any mistakes in the race and is literally the god in wet conditions.  

Tidbits about Hamilton: He's currently the only Black driver on the grid. His personality is a little...... weird, sometimes makes controversial comments off the track.

### Valtteri Bottas (#77)

Nationality: Finnish  

Age: 31  

Drives for: Mercedes  

A very decent driver that gets the job done. Not good enough nor consistent enough to challenge his GOAT teammate for the whole year. Can maybe pick up a few pole positions and race wins every season because of the dominant Mercedes car.  

Tidbits about Bottas: Mercedes say they let their drivers fairly race each other without favoring Hamilton (which I believe they do), but fans often joke that he's the "wingman" to Hamilton which makes Bottas very pissed. But if you're just not quick enough, what else can you do?

### Max Verstappen (#33)

Nationality: Dutch 

Age: 23  

Drives for: Red Bull Racing

My favorite driver on the grid. Extremely fierce and talented. Widely considered to be the only driver that could challenge Hamilton in equal machinery. At such a young age he already has 10 race wins under his belt, all while driving only the 2nd or 3rd best car.

The guy's so incredibly talented that he went from karting to a full-time F1 drive in a little bit more than a year, which is absolutely ridiculous. He used to be quite impetuous and had a lot of incidents before 2018 but these few years saw him become a much more mature driver, but no less exciting.

> His dad, Jos Verstappen, also drove in F1 and was briefly teammates with Michael Schumacher.
>
> He was promoted from Toro Rosso (i.e. the current AlphaTauri) to Red Bull midway in 2016 and immediately went on to win his first race ([2016 Spanish GP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hohuswdeznA)) with Red Bull. Truly remarkable.
>
> He may have the craziest fan base of any driver. You can see huge groups of his fans wearing the Dutch orange color in every single race. He even has dedicated grandstands in some GPs.
>
> Some of his race highlights that I still watch over and over again: ['16 Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO3q69x2sXA), ['19 Austria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3L7WzpAsjY), ['19 Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZeoOkMf0Y).

## The Cars

<img src=".\pics\car_diagram.jpeg" alt="F1 Car" style="zoom:50%; width:50%;" />

Formula 1 cars are insanely complex and powerful machines. A couple of quick facts:

* F1 cars are able to accelerate from 0 to 100 mph and come to a full stop in only 4 to 5 seconds. They are able to reach max speeds of 230mph.
* F1 cars are so aerodynamic and generate so much [downforce](#downforce-and-dirty-air) that they can (theoretically) drive upside down when up to speed. Nobody ever tested this though, for obvious reasons.

Alright, moving on to the different parts of the car.

### Power Unit

The current F1 power units are 1.6-liter V6 hybrid turbocharged engines. These engines are capable of outputting 900hp, plus an additional 160hp generated by electrical components. The engines idle at around 6000 rpm and reaches a top of 15000 rpm.

The mechanical part of the power unit includes the internal combustion engine and the turbocharger. The electrical part includes an energy recovery system to harvest energy from. The harvested electrical energy is stored in an energy storage (ES), basically the battery, and deployed when the driver needs an extra boost. The control electronics (CE) are also considered part of the power unit.

The power unit is the single most expensive part on the car, costing over $10 million to produce (not development costs!). Due to the significance of power units to the performance of the car, this era (2014-present) where these power units are used is called the **"turbo hybrid era"**. Mercedes dominated this era by having the best power unit on the grid.

Not all teams develop their own PU. There are only 4 engine manufacturers. Teams that develop their own engines are called "works teams". Other teams that buy the power units and use them are "customer teams". Currently, the engine manufacturers and their customers are:

* Mercedes --- Works team: Mercedes; Customer teams: Aston Martin, McLaren, Williams.
* Ferrari --- Works team: Ferrari; Customer teams: Haas, Alfa Romeo.
* Renault --- Works team: Alpine; No customer team.
* Honda --- Developed externally by Honda R&D; Customer teams: Red Bull, AlphaTauri.

A general ranking of engine performances: Mercedes > Ferrari = Renault > Honda. Mercedes engine has always been really good. Ferrari engine regressed compared to a few years ago. Renault and Honda engines has shown improvement and I think their performances are not too far away from Ferrari.

### Tyres

### Bodywork

DRS is a moveable flap in the rear wing that can be triggered to open on specific parts of the track (called DRS zones, usually placed on long straights, out of cornering sections). If the gap between two cars is less than 1 second when approaching the DRS zone, the following car is allowed to use DRS. 

## The Tracks

## More Technical Concepts

Here are some of the more technical concepts in F1 racing. You can read it if you're curious but it's not absolutely necessary if you just want to understand what's going on and enjoy the race.

### Slipstreaming

Slipstreaming is the act of closely following another car on the straights. You know how the leading car punches a hole in the air so there's less drag for the following car. The following car can get into the slipstream to gain a bit more speed, but there's this issue below ↓

### Downforce and "Dirty Air"

F1 cars require downforce to be able to get around corners. This is the aerodynamic force generated by the wings and other body parts when at high speeds to push the car against the ground so the tyre rubber can work its magic. It is exactly the same principle as the wings of an airplane, just flipped on its back.
Following the car too closely causes the air flow around the car to be disrupted (the air being "dirty") so it loses downforce, which severely affects cornering and braking performance. F1 introduced DRS to try to solve this problem.

### More on DRS

F1 introduced the DRS to mitigate this loss of downforce and to somehow "make up" for lost time in the corners. When DRS is open, air can pass **through** the rear wing instead of **over** it, thus reducing drag. This creates a bit of extra speed (in addition to slipstreaming) for the following car so it can attack the car ahead.

### Understeer and Oversteer

Understeer is when the car doesn't turn into corners very well and runs wide. This is usually associated with the lack of front downforce.

Oversteer is when the car turns too much into a corner and the back end becomes unstable or even swings around. This is usually associated with the lack of rear downforce.

You can set up the wing angles to be steeper to increase downforce at the front or at the back, but then it sacrifices speed on the straights, because a steeper wing angle apparently blocks airflow and creates drag.

### Race Strategy Basics

- Undercut  
  Imagine you are stuck behind your rival and couldn't overtake him. You decide to pit **earlier** than your rival, come out with a fresh set of tyres, do a blisteringly fast lap while your rival is struggling on older tyres, and when he eventually does a pitstop you are already in front of him. So you swapped places with him without an on-track overtake.
- Overcut  
  Basically the reverse of undercut. You're stuck behind your rival and couldn't overtake him. You decide to pit **later** than your rival. Your rival does his pitstop but couldn't get the new tyres to work immediately, but you managed to squeeze out the final bits of performance on your used set of tyres, so when you eventually complete your pitstop, the lap time differences allowed you to get ahead of your rival without an on-track overtake.

I believe undercuts are generally much more common, mainly because old tyres are generally supposed to be slower than new tyres, but there are lots of factors that affect tyre performance so it's not always the case.

## News in the Paddock

Just a bit of recent news to let you know what everyone in the paddock is talking about:

- Arguably the biggest news: F1 will introduce a big overhaul of technical regulations for next season (2022). The cars will look [quite different](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fia-announce-new-f1-regulations-to-be-delayed-until-2022.1lwtaLmpNcQd0z9SnMEyK8.html). This is mainly to let the teams close up and improve the quality of racing.
- In the 2021 Season, F1 will trial what's called "sprint qualifying" for three GPs this year. Basically, they want to try out a 1/3 race (100km) to replace traditional [elimination qualifying](#qualifying).
- Honda will quit F1 after the 2021 season. Red Bull has acquired their engine business to form Red Bull Powertrain, so they can technically be considered as a works team.

## More F1-related Content

- Obviously, [r/formula1](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/). (Also maybe, [r/formuladank](https://www.reddit.com/r/formuladank/))
- The official [F1 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Formula1) is awesome. You got the multi-million dollar production quality, and also the interesting content and ideas like a really good fan-made channel.
- A British YouTuber [Chain Bear](https://www.youtube.com/user/chainbearf1) has great videos explaining how everything works in F1, including the technical stuff, race strategy, etc. Love it.
- The Netflix show [Drive to Survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) has attracted a large number of new fans from the US recently. It's really well made, in fact the only reason I subscribe to Netflix for 1 month every year. There's quite a lot of drama, although also some forced and manufactured drama. It covers many more interesting characters and stories in the paddock than what I can include in this guide. All in all a very good show. Season 3 premieres on March 19.
- Some pretty reliable websites and media outlets: [Autosport.com](https://www.autosport.com/), [The Race](https://the-race.com/), [RaceFans.net](https://www.racefans.net/), [Motorsport.com](https://www.motorsport.com/), to name a few.
