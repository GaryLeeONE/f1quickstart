# Championship and Event Format

The **FIA Formula One World Championship** runs annually from around mid-March to late-November or early-December. F1 is considered the pinnacle of motorsport and its popularity around the world ranks only behind the Olympic Games and the World Cup.

F1 is sanctioned by the [Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fédération_Internationale_de_l'Automobile) (FIA), based in Paris, France.

The typical schedule for recent years consists of 21~23 race events, called "Grand Prix". The Grands Prix usually run every two weeks, but there are some back-to-back race weeks, as well as a month-long summer break in August. These event happen across the world in 20+ countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Oceania.

Currently 10 teams participate in the Championship, each team with 2 drivers. The 20 drivers are from 13 different countries around the world, truly a global sport and a global community.

Teams are also called *constructors* because they design and construct their own cars each year.

Every Grand Prix happens from Friday to Sunday of the race week. The sessions are:

- Free Practice 1 (FP1, 90 minutes long) and Free Practice 2 (FP2, 90 minutes long) on Friday
- Free Practice 3 (FP3, 60 minutes long) and Qualifying on Saturday
- Race on Sunday

### Free Practice Sessions

The 3 Practice sessions are for drivers to, you know, practice. They are also for the teams to fiddle with the setup of the car to maximize performance. No championship points are awarded during practice sessions.

I hardly ever watch practice sessions live. I usually only check the timesheets after each session.

### Qualifying

Qualifying, or "quali" for short, is to determine the starting positions (i.e. the "grid") for the Sunday race.

Qualifying is very much like a sprint: each driver tries to **set one quick lap time**. Only the fastest lap of each driver are compared, slower laps are ignored.

The drivers have multiple shots of doing so in each of these three smaller sections:

- Q1 (18 mins), all 20 drivers participate. The slowest 5 drivers (P16 to P20) are eliminated and cannot participate in Q2 and Q3. These drivers' starting grid positions are set.
- Q2 (15 mins), top 15 drivers from Q1 participate. The slowest 5 drivers (P11 to P15) are eliminated and cannot participate in Q3. These drivers' starting grid positions are also set.
- Q3 (12 mins), top 10 drivers from Q2 participate. This shootout determines the starting grid positions for P1 to P10. P1 is called "Pole Position".

### Race

The Race is, of course, the glamorous main event of every race weekend.

The race runs for a set number of laps (different for each circuit) but the total race distance for each race is always a little bit over 300 km or 180 miles (with one exception: the Monaco GP). The races generally take around 90 minutes to complete, barring any severe incidents causing stoppages.

Championship points are awarded to the drivers and teams each race based on race results:

| Finishing Position | P1   | P2   | P3   | P4   | P5   | P6   | P7   | P8   | P9   | P10  |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Points             | 25   | 18   | 15   | 12   | 10   | 8    | 6    | 4    | 2    | 1    |

Also, the driver who does the **fastest lap in the race** will be awarded 1 extra point, but only if he finishes in the top 10.

The **Driver's World Champion** is whoever scores the most points over the season. Each team's points are the sum of the points of their drivers. The **Constructor's World Champion** is whichever team that scores the most points.

That's pretty much how the championship is structured. There are no postseason, playoffs or all-star events like in North American sports.

### Side Notes

* Pole position, race win, and podium finish (top-3) are all very noteworthy achievements in a driver's F1 career.<!-- * The grid positions may be changed after qualifying. If a driver or team violated the sporting regulations, such as blocking other drivers on the track, changing a car part that they're not allowed to change, etc., they may be penalized in the form of dropping places on the starting grid. Similarly, drivers can get penalized during the race if they caused a collision, cut corners, forced other drivers off track, etc. The penalties include adding a few seconds to your race time, forcing you to drive through the pitlane (which has a speed limit), or even disqualification. -->
* All drivers have to do one mandatory pitstop during the race. F1 bans refueling during the race, so pitstops are pretty much only used to change tyres, and/or change the front wing if there's significant damage to it. Teams use the word "box" to tell the drivers to come in for a pitstop.
* When incidents happen during the race, leaving debris on track, the FIA will deploy the Safety Car (American motorsports call the Pace Car) which all cars must follow and bunch up behind. No overtakes are allowed and everyone drives at a much lower speed than normal racing speeds. The track workers (called "marshals") can then have a safe gap to clean up the mess. This year's Safety Car duties will be shared between two very stunning vehicles: the Mercedes-AMG GT R and the Aston Martin Vantage.
