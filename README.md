# A Quick Start Guide of Formula One (2021 Season)

This guide includes some of the most important knowledge and concepts that I think is necessary for a new fan to understand what's going on and enjoy the sport. I also added some personal twists and extra stuff that I think is interesting to read. This is because from a sporting sense, F1 is by no means very complex: it's just driving cars, fast! Dramatic crashes and overtakes! The sport itself should be relatively easy to pick up. However, as you can imagine, from a technical standpoint F1 cars are engineering marvels. Each team hires hundreds of the best aerodynamicists, material scientists and engineers in the world, then spends hundreds of millions of dollars developing and producing each year's cars.

If you just wanted to experience the sport and the spectacle, you only need to read the [Championship and Event Formats](championship.md).

Want to know a bit more about the stories? Go to the [Teams and Drivers](teams_and_drivers.md) section.

If you want to learn about some of the details, that will be the [Cars and more Technicals](technicals.md) part.

Hope you enjoy!

- Obviously, [r/formula1](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/). (Also maybe, [r/formuladank](https://www.reddit.com/r/formuladank/))<!-- - The Netflix show [Drive to Survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) has attracted a large number of new fans from the US recently. It's really well made, in fact the only reason I subscribe to Netflix for 1 month every year. There's quite a lot of drama, although also some forced and manufactured drama. It covers many more interesting characters and stories in the paddock than what I can include in this guide. All in all a very good show. Season 3 premieres on March 19. -->
