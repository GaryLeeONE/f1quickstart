# A Quick Start Guide of Formula One (2021 Season)

This guide includes some of the most important knowledge and concepts that I think is necessary for a new fan to understand what's going on and enjoy the sport. I also added some personal twists and extra stuff that I think is interesting to read. This is because from a sporting sense, F1 is by no means very complex: it's just driving cars, fast! Dramatic crashes and overtakes! The sport itself should be relatively easy to pick up. However, as you can imagine, from a technical standpoint F1 cars are engineering marvels. Each team hires hundreds of the best aerodynamicists, material scientists and engineers in the world, then spends hundreds of millions of dollars developing and producing each year's cars.

If you just wanted to experience the sport and the spectacle, you only need to read the [Championship and Event Formats](championship.md). If you want to learn about some of the details, that will be Chapters 4 to 6. Finally, Chapter 7 is basically how I search for F1 related content. Recommend you to take a peek at that as well.

I'm not a huge history guy, so I didn't include anything related to the early history of F1. Everything here pretty much dates back only to when I started following F1, which is around 2016. You'll quickly learn the big names and famous stories if you decide to start following.

Hope you enjoy!
